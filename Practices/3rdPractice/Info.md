### A few things:

Many of the files are explained through a lot of comments. Many are garbage, some are useful.

If something is wrong, generate an issue for this repo specifying the folder. The code *should* work, but I am open-minded.

In addition:

```bash
# To compile it. Nothing surprising
g++ main_polynomial.cpp -o main_polynomial

# To execute it
./main_polynomial < data_polynomial.txt

# (can use data_polynomial2.txt or work with a new file with the correct format)
```
